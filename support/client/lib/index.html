    <!-- extension modules. There are two flavors. Models directly control the simulation but    -->
    <!-- cannot accept external input. The model configuration is identical for all participants -->
    <!-- in a shared world. Views may accept external input -such as pointer and key events or   -->
    <!-- directives from a connection to an outside engine that is not visible to all users- but -->
    <!-- may only affect the simulation indirectly through the synchronization server.           -->
